# Evolution-of-CCMs

This project is a collaboration between Courtney Stepien and Heroen Verbruggen.

Our goal is to understand how Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms (CCMs) in red seaweeds (Rhodophyta) have evolved over time in conjunction with or in response to historic atmospheric changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations.
